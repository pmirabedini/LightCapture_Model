# LightCapture_Model
The LightCapture model is a python code to find the correlation between pillar's geometry (radius and length) and the probability distribution of absorbed light through the length of pillar. The results can help designing more efficient systems for photocatalytic reactions in water splitting and waste-water treatment applications. 
To use the code, download the attched files and follow the steps to generate the results.
