# LightCapture_Model
The LightCapture model is a python-based raytracing code designed to find the correlation between micropillars' geometry and light absorption through the length of pillars in microfluidic reactors. The results potentially contribute to developing more efficient structures for photocatalytic reactions in waste-water treatment applications. 

To use the code, download the attched files and follow the steps in the README.txt file.
